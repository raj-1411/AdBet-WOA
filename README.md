# Adaptive $\beta$-Hill Climbing Aided Whale Optimization Algorithm (AdBet-WOA)
- This repository contains the official implementation of our paper titled **"Deep Feature Selection using Adaptive $\beta$-Hill Climbing aided Whale Optimization Algorithm for Lung and Colon Cancer Detection"** submitted to Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Elsevier.

## Overview
- AdBet-WOA is a hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm using the Adaptive $\beta$-Hill Climbing local search property as the exploitation agent in the popular Whale Optimization Algorithm.
- The overall flowchart of **AdBet-WOA** and its Pseudo-algorithm are given as follows : <p align="center">
